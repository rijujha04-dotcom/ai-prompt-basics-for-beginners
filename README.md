# ai-prompt-basics-for-non-technical beginner
This project is created to explain the basics of Generative AI and prompt writing in simple language for non-technical beginners.
The goal of this project is to help anyone understand how AI works, how to give better instructions (prompts), and what limitations AI has.
## What is Generative AI?
Generative AI is a type of smart computer technology that can create new things instead of only finding or showing old information.
Examples of Generative AI tools:
- ChatGPT
- Google Gemini
- Claude
These tools help users by answering questions, writing content, and explaining topics in an easy way.
## What is a Prompt?
A prompt is the instruction or question that we give to an AI tool.
Example:
"Act as a teacher and explain Artificial Intelligence in simple language."
The clarity of the prompt decides how good or bad the AI response will be.
## How AI Understands Instructions
AI does not think like humans.
It works by predicting the next best word based on patterns from training data.
AI understands:
- Role (Act as a teacher)
- Task (Explain AI)
- Style (Simple language)
Clear and specific prompts help AI give better answers.
## Good Prompt vs Bad Prompt
### Bad Prompt
Explain AI.
## Improved Prompt
Act as a school teacher and explain Artificial Intelligence to a class 10 student using simple language and real-life examples.
### Observation
The improved prompt gives a clearer, more useful response because the role, audience, and style are defined.
## Limitations of AI
1. Hallucinations  
AI can sometimes give confident but incorrect answers.
2. Bias  
AI responses can reflect bias from training data.
3. Errors and Outdated Information  
AI may not always have the latest or correct information.
Because of these limitations, AI outputs should always be verified by humans.
